1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
There are three main things that if you

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,440
care about them make picking Obsidian

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,520
over other note-taking apps a great

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,160
idea. First, if you want near zero

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,559
friction to capture your own ideas.

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,599
Second, if you value connecting those

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,359
ideas using links and back links. And

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,920
third, if you want to improve your

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,039
thinking, learning, and writing while

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,199
using an offline local first format you

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,439
can take with you anywhere instead of

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
being stuck in one app or format. If

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,599
that's you, I'm about to share the

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,840
essential 80% of all those features in

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,079
Obsidian and how you can use them to get

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,760
the most out of Obsidian in the shortest

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,160
time. Let's start with what Obsidian

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,239
actually is, which is just a vault, a

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,280
folder of notes on your computer. Here

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,680
it is right here on my desktop. It's

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,320
that simple. Inside this folder, your

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,320
notes are just individual text files.

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,800
These files are in a futurep proof

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,440
format called Markdown. Open those files

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,600
in Obsidian and they look like this. But

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,920
you can also open them in any other app

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,760
that reads markdown. Here's the same

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,159
note in text edit in VS Code, Ulyses,

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,080
IIA Rider. So even if Obsidian

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,720
disappears, as long as there are

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,400
computers, you'll have a way to open

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,400
your notes because at the end of the

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,759
day, Obsidian is just looking at a

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,840
folder with notes on your computer. You

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,080
own your data. But if you want to sync

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,840
Obsidian across devices, there are ways

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,560
to sync your vaults. You just connect

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,680
Obsidian with any cloud storage service

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,240
like Dropbox or Obsidian Sync, which is

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,200
one of Obsidian's few paid official

41
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,759
services, allowing you endtoend

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,479
encryption and version history of all

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,960
your vaults. Obsidian is so secure that

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,119
no one on their sevenperson team even

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,439
knows how many people have installed the

46
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,880
app. Though their CEO estimates that

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,960
it's between 5 to 10 million.

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,799
So, how does Obsidian work? Once you

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,759
open Obsidian and create your first

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,759
vault, you'll be here. Now, over on the

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,000
left, here's a list of all the notes in

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,439
your vault. Create a new note here. It's

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,840
called Untitled. Let's go ahead and

54
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,920
throw it in the folder. We can go ahead

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,080
and create a new folder here. If we want

56
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,080
to sort, we can click this and sort by

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,680
file name or modified time or many

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,680
others. If you lose where the current

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,920
open note is in the sidebar, go ahead

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,680
and click this and it will autoreveal

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,560
the current file. And this button

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,840
expands and collapses your folders. You

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,280
go a little bit higher. Here's the

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,360
search button where you can search

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,120
across your entire vault of notes. If

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,200
you click over here, there are bookmarks

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,360
where we can bookmark different files

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,760
that are important to us. or click back

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,840
here and we're back to the file folder

70
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,280
structure. And then click on a note to

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,760
see it in the right. You can

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,080
commandclick or control-click on Mac or

73
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,400
Windows to open notes in new tabs. Once

74
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,040
open, you can click and drag a tab and

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,440
move it anywhere into different panels

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,319
for your unique type of multitasking.

77
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,120
Obsidian has a crazy amount of plugins

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,040
and themes, folders, and metadata that

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,200
you can add to your notes. It can be as

80
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,360
simple as a note like this with a couple

81
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,599
sentences and a couple links or

82
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,120
something as complex as this with tons

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,879
of property, images, embeds, and

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,560
personal details. There's a steep

85
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,800
learning curve if you try to do

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,120
everything at once. So, let's start by

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,599
making the simplest possible collection

88
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,680
of notes. So, let's go ahead and create

89
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:29,360
a new note and let's say do things the

90
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,720
right way. Then I can tab and start

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,400
typing. Now already you can see a new

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,720
dot, a new node in our idea verse in the

93
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,440
graph view on the right. Now let's add

94
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,400
some content. Now the beauty of Obsidian

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,879
is you can create and connect notes at

96
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,599
the same time. We'll think of something

97
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:54,720
this reminds us of. So do things the

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:59,200
right way. This reminds me of

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,640
believe things better than you found

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,959
them. Nice. And how we link in the first

101
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,799
place is we hit the left bracket twice

102
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,280
and then we start typing. How about a

103
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,599
new one? Family phrases to live by. And

104
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,599
for me, I'll now hit the right bracket

105
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,120
twice and then period. And over on the

106
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,799
right, we can see in the graph view, do

107
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,199
things the right way, connecting to the

108
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,360
two new placeholder notes. But what's

109
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,440
wild is these notes, even though they're

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
not created, will still show up in any

111
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,639
type of search that you do. But if you

112
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,280
do want to make it a new note, let's go

113
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,840
ahead and commandclick on it on Mac.

114
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,919
That would be a controlclick on Windows.

115
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,280
And boom, now it's its new note. If we

116
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,400
look at the graph view now, we can see

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,680
it's a darker dot. it's been created as

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,000
opposed to the family phrases idea which

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,160
has not been created into a note yet. By

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
the way, if you close this graph view,

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,320
which is a tab over here, rightclick,

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,560
hit close, you can always reopen it with

123
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,560
a little ribbon button here. So, we can

124
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,040
reopen the graph view and now we see it

125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,280
in all its glory. You can adjust all

126
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,120
sorts of graph variables, especially as

127
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,720
your graph grows to this. This is idea

128
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,880
verse pro. There are links below if you

129
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,280
want to learn more about it cuz here you

130
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,000
can see all sorts of surprising

131
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,479
connections. Not all those who wander

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,400
are lost. We can learn from nerdy

133
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,400
discussions on maps of content,

134
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,000
evergreen notes or things or statements

135
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,160
about things. And we're off to the

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,639
races. Who knows where this will lead?

137
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,400
You can jump into any note and simply

138
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,039
highlight some text and then hit the

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,360
left bracket twice. When you do that,

140
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,360
you'll notice the new dot has appeared

141
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,759
on the graph view. to see all mentions

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,160
of a linked note. In the bottom right,

143
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,479
there are back links to the active note.

144
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,800
You can go ahead and collapse linked

145
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,960
mentions. So, you can see all those. You

146
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,160
can expand to see exactly what it says

147
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,320
as it links to the active note. Speaking

148
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,400
of links, before we go further, there's

149
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,960
a few crucial settings that will save

150
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,960
you massive headaches down the road.

151
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,600
Open settings. Go to files and links and

152
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,360
turn on automatically update internal

153
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,560
links. Now, here's why this is

154
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,560
important. If you rename a note to a new

155
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,440
note name and then click away, do see

156
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,919
that notification updated links in two

157
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,319
files. With this setting, the links

158
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,639
updated automatically to point to the

159
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,800
renamed note. Without this setting,

160
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,319
renames will break links and you might

161
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,759
end up with a bunch of broken

162
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,440
connections. Let's change some other

163
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,840
quick settings. So, if you click over

164
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,880
here, we can now change the default

165
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,880
folder for attachments to a new folder

166
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,560
for attachments. This is really

167
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,720
important to avoid cluttering up the

168
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,960
sidebar whenever you want to add a new

169
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,479
image or other documents to a note.

170
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,720
While we're fiddling with settings, I

171
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,199
want to recommend changing your theme to

172
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,319
know how to do it. So, just click

173
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,880
appearances, then manage under themes,

174
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,960
and select Anapuchin. A nu. There it is.

175
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,080
Install. Now, this is a very popular

176
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,160
theme that acts as a base for the soft

177
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,240
paper theme that I recommend for

178
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,680
Obsidian. Check out this video next for

179
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,919
all those details, which I'll speed

180
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,560
through right now to get us all the soft

181
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,479
papery goodness.

182
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,479
Next, some quick gotchas and mistakes

183
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,720
that trip people up with Obsidian. The

184
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,199
first gotcha, don't import everything

185
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,919
from your old notes app. I see people do

186
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,479
this all the time. They dump thousands

187
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,080
of other old notes into Obsidian and

188
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,319
then they wonder why they can't find

189
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,720
anything. Start fresh. Link your own

190
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,880
thoughts. Don't drown in old clutter.

191
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Second, keep it simple with plugins.

192
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,440
Avoid starting with things like advanced

193
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,000
tables, canban boards, data view

194
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,759
dashboards, and a lot more. I know it's

195
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,400
incredibly tempting, but don't chase

196
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,720
plugins on day one. I'll link a video on

197
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,400
essential plugins below if you want to

198
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,960
peak, but focus on linking first. Third,

199
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,160
don't overfolder your ideas or knowledge

200
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,160
notes. Structure must be earned. We'll

201
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,080
get into all that in a second and the

202
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,840
level of structure that I do recommend,

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,400
but when you're dealing with ideas and

204
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,120
knowledge, categories get so fuzzy and

205
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,000
ambiguous that standard hierarchies

206
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,720
become brittle. Keep things in big

207
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,879
buckets until patterns naturally show

208
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,280
up. Finally, don't put off learning

209
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,160
hotkeys. The faster you can do work in

210
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,160
Obsidian, the more you'll enjoy it.

211
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,039
Speaking of, let's talk about how to

212
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,120
make our notemaking faster. First, you

213
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,360
can do everything with your mouse if you

214
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,000
want by right-clicking and selecting

215
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,399
formatting. But trust me, you want to

216
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,240
learn to use hotkeys. Here are a few

217
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,719
essentials. Now, I'm going to be saying

218
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,120
command and option for Mac. So, think

219
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,320
control and alt if you're on Windows.

220
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,600
CommandB to bold. Command I to it

221
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,519
atalicize. Add the pound symbols at the

222
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,160
beginning of a line to create headings

223
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,600
of different sizes. Surround text with

224
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,320
two tildas to strike through and two

225
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,440
equal signs to highlight. A greater than

226
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,920
sign will create a quote block. A dash

227
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,480
will create a bullet list. Numbers

228
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,040
create numbered lists. Dashes plus

229
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,519
brackets start a checklist and three

230
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,880
lines on an empty line will create a

231
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:16,240
divider. One back tick for inline code

232
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,720
and three ticks for a code block. Again,

233
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,640
link to notes with double brackets or

234
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,560
you can link to an external site. To do

235
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,839
that, put the link text here and the

236
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,640
link in parenthesis. Command option left

237
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,880
or right keys will navigate back or

238
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,320
forward instead of clicking the icons

239
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,519
here.

240
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,040
Command F to find text on the page.

241
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,680
Command T will open a new tab. Command W

242
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,920
closes it. And if you add an exclamation

243
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,240
point before a link to another note, you

244
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,480
can embed that entire note inside

245
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,800
another. And adding an exclamation point

246
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,000
before an external link will display an

247
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,000
image if it is one. Finally, command P

248
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,640
will open the command pallet where

249
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,360
you'll find reminders of these shortcuts

250
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,040
as well as many more advanced shortcuts.

251
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,600
Combine these tips and you can create

252
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,440
beautiful notes in Obsidian.

253
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,800
So, can we get around Obsidian and

254
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,760
organize these beautiful notes

255
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,360
effectively? Yes. Command O opens the

256
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,839
quick switcher to find or open a note

257
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,600
fast. But the standard way to navigate

258
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,760
is through your sidebar. As you make

259
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,760
notes, they'll populate here. So, if you

260
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,680
want to organize things more, create

261
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,240
folders in the left sidebar and put your

262
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,640
notes into them. Don't just do this

263
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,800
making folders with random topics

264
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,560
because if you do this long enough,

265
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,560
you'll realize it's pretty hard to find

266
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,480
your notes or remember where they are.

267
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,480
That's because a lot of notes can exist

268
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,399
in five or 10 different folders. So,

269
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,720
there's all sorts of decision fatigue

270
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,560
just to place a single note. So, what I

271
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,040
suggest is building a folder structure

272
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,360
only as it deserves it and making the

273
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,519
biggest picture folder categories

274
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,079
possible. You can then use your quick

275
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,839
switcher links between notes and even

276
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,000
the graph view to get a better sense of

277
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,240
where notes live. Over time, you can

278
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,920
create a more sophisticated structure.

279
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,160
Now, I've built a free template called

280
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,640
Ideverse, which you can get by scanning

281
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,720
here that can get you started building a

282
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,880
solid foundation. But hey, right now,

283
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,880
let's walk through the basics. Ace AC

284
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,880
atlas is for your timeless ideas and

285
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,959
knowledge. Calendar is for your

286
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,680
timebased notes like a journal or a

287
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,440
daily note. Efforts are for timebound

288
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,160
things, things you're working on,

289
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,560
projects, tasks, anything productivity

290
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,480
oriented. This is a great simple way to

291
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,200
organize your vault and then create

292
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,560
subfolders under each as necessary. Some

293
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,040
other ways to organize your notes

294
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,720
include bookmarking by hitting the three

295
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,720
buttons and seeing it in the drop down

296
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,360
or hit command P and pull up the

297
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,440
bookmark command. You can tag notes by

298
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,760
using the pound key to bundle and filter

299
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,600
by types of notes wherever they are in

300
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Obsidian. More often than not, I

301
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,600
recommend instead of tags, creating maps

302
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,920
of content. These are notes that

303
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,800
organize and link other notes together

304
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,680
by topic or theme and create really

305
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,279
strong connective hubs in your graph

306
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,360
view. And if you're capturing quick

307
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,200
thoughts in Obsidian, creating a daily

308
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,120
note structure in the calendar section

309
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,360
of your folders is a great way to

310
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,440
capture daily thoughts on the fly and

311
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,320
then link out to the rest of your idea

312
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,079
verse as needed. Okay, let's talk

313
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,399
Obsidian's different note formats.

314
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,560
Standard notes in Obsidian are textbased

315
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,639
markdown files, but you can add in all

316
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,120
sorts of things. First, you can embed

317
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,079
images directly into your notes. Just

318
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,959
drag and drop an image file right there.

319
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,880
You can attach PDFs, audio recordings,

320
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,959
and a bunch of other documents. You can

321
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,600
turn on the audio recorder core plugin

322
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,079
for quick voice memos or embed YouTube

323
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,040
videos and even tweets. Tables are easy

324
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,279
to build by hitting command P, typing

325
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,760
table, which will give you insert table,

326
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,760
then hit enter. or try the templates

327
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,120
core plug-in which lets you create and

328
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,360
repurpose notes in reusable formats. To

329
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,160
get even more sophisticated organizing

330
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,399
and filtering notes in your idea verse,

331
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,240
you can add properties to notes like

332
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,480
created date, checkboxes, links, text,

333
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,440
numbers, all this to your notes without

334
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,240
cluttering the content. Just hit command

335
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,399
semicolon to add a new property. Then

336
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,480
set up as many as you like. Air

337
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,040
properties with Obsidian's basis feature

338
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,600
to create really cool organizational

339
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,639
formats that can be sorted and updated

340
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,200
by note type or visualize your notes

341
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,079
with Obsidian's canvas, a virtual

342
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,320
whiteboard to drag in notes, images, or

343
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,399
new cards for brainstorming. By the way,

344
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,959
more details on setting up bases or

345
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,839
canvas in the links below. Finally,

346
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,000
let's talk about how Obsidian does AI,

347
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,000
which is easy enough since Obsidian

348
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,800
doesn't have AI. Instead, you get to

349
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,880
decide how much AI and what ways it

350
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,720
integrates. Pick based on how private

351
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,720
you need your data to be and how much

352
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,279
you're willing to do to preserve that

353
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,440
privacy. Right now, I'm using Claude, an

354
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,000
AI that allows me to do things like ask

355
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,760
questions, and talk to my notes, do deep

356
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,399
research, and instantly populate

357
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,240
properties in Obsidian. I always back up

358
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,720
my notes first before trying anything

359
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,440
new with AI. And I create a separation

360
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,639
between my idea verse, my original

361
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,000
thinking and any AI generated notes so

362
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,160
that Obsidian stays a sacred space for

363
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,240
